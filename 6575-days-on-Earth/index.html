Yes, you!</h6>
Long? that's just the beginning, nothing.
the journey is just about to begin, brace yourself! the universe isn't that kidding, realize!

<p>How good does it feel when the birthday comes, birthday cake? friend? or even a party? it will all come automatically like a machine, aka a celebration and its partner, especially if it’s not a surprise.<br>BUT IT WAS, very long … so long.</p>
<p>Now? crazy! I just don’t want to do that anymore, it’s nothing, it’s just that when that day comes again and again I feel that there is an increasing burden and I am required to be mature, yes that’s a consequence that must be accepted. Is not it?? or maybe just me? Ah I don’t think so, but I don’t know.</p>
<p>Every time that day comes I always think <code>&#39;what have I done? (For myself and others)&#39;</code> often confused to answer the question, not to mention other questions (which came from my own head of course).</p>
<p>But it’s still the very foundation of what comes out of my mind, I will feel like a person having a panic attack when the question of how my future is, not only briefly but I sometimes think about it until I get stressed.<br>it sounds stupid, but that’s how stupid I am.<br>Think things are still far ahead, you idiot!</p>
<p>now to the point, load.<br>the number of days is increasing, the burden will be heavier and closer, yes how could the pigeon mother find <i><code>food</code></i> for her children, and her child will find <i><code>food</code></i> for her, not to mention if the child is not alone, aka having a smaller sibling, it must be a challenges for children who have smaller siblings. thoughts of ‘can I find <i><code>food</code></i> for my parents and younger siblings?’ it always popped into the child’s head.<br>Wait, what ?? The pigeon is not like that<br>yes, I also know, but that is just a picture, with what I am experiencing at this time. the child’s mind is the same as mine, damn it!</p>
<p>well, that’s a little what’s on my mind.</p>

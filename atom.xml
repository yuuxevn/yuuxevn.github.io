    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h6>Mastering to be lonely</h6>Quiet? feels familiar from the first, even like a friend .... really likes that.but why now even become afraid and even hide from it.I don't know, what's wrong with me, maybe the loneliness I feel now is different from the loneliness it used to be.<p>I realize that the current loneliness is more because I want to reach the top of Mount A and not all of my friends / colleagues want to reach the same mountain (I hope, you know what I mean), it’s a sense of loneliness now.</p><p><strong><em><code>Isn&#39;t there one person or several people who have the same goal?</code></em></strong></p><p>of course there is! because actually all friends are in the same camp, but not all of them want to move to get to the top, as if it looks like natural selection, but not explicitly. sounds funny huh? haha, but it’s the choice of each individual, I have no right to sue them. and from there there are fewer and fewer <code>&#39;participants&#39;</code> participating in the event. and yes, this loneliness is getting closer.</p><p>Let’s get over some of the cowardly <strong>sheep</strong> who are comfortable in the camp, ‘cause I have an interesting subject than that.<br>After I saw and heard about (video title), it was explained that feeling lonely when we want to reach the top of a mountain is natural.<br>and about friends slowly leaving us? of course, they also discussed it.<br>Is it natural? It is reasonable! I repeat it again <strong>N A T U R A L !</strong></p><p>For those of you who are feeling the same way, calm down! you are not alone I also feel that way. It’s quiet, there are no friends to accompany you, but believing it all will pay off, it’s just not easy.<br>Be patient and consistent with what you are pursuing / working on, see you above!</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h6>Are you still alive? Yes, you!</h6>Long? that's just the beginning, nothing.the journey is just about to begin, brace yourself! the universe isn't that kidding, realize!<p>How good does it feel when the birthday comes, birthday cake? friend? or even a party? it will all come automatically like a machine, aka a celebration and its partner, especially if it’s not a surprise.<br>BUT IT WAS, very long … so long.</p><p>Now? crazy! I just don’t want to do that anymore, it’s nothing, it’s just that when that day comes again and again I feel that there is an increasing burden and I am required to be mature, yes that’s a consequence that must be accepted. Is not it?? or maybe just me? Ah I don’t think so, but I don’t know.</p><p>Every time that day comes I always think <code>&#39;what have I done? (For myself and others)&#39;</code> often confused to answer the question, not to mention other questions (which came from my own head of course).</p><p>But it’s still the very foundation of what comes out of my mind, I will feel like a person having a panic attack when the question of how my future is, not only briefly but I sometimes think about it until I get stressed.<br>it sounds stupid, but that’s how stupid I am.<br>Think things are still far ahead, you idiot!</p><p>now to the point, load.<br>the number of days is increasing, the burden will be heavier and closer, yes how could the pigeon mother find <i><code>food</code></i> for her children, and her child will find <i><code>food</code></i> for her, not to mention if the child is not alone, aka having a smaller sibling, it must be a challenges for children who have smaller siblings. thoughts of ‘can I find <i><code>food</code></i> for my parents and younger siblings?’ it always popped into the child’s head.<br>Wait, what ?? The pigeon is not like that<br>yes, I also know, but that is just a picture, with what I am experiencing at this time. the child’s mind is the same as mine, damn it!</p><p>well, that’s a little what’s on my mind.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h6> This is between Me, Code and Error. </h6>So, from the title it is clear this is like a <i>'trial'</i> program for many developers when using new technology(for some reason hello world I also don't know).<p>I loved computers very much, and when I graduated from junior high school I decided to go to a vocational school and then major in software engineering. so from there I know programming (10th grade school which was about 2 years ago).</p><p>I am also not a person who is very skilled in this field(only 2 years of study), but at least not really a newbie hahaha. the motivation to continue learning is always within me even though I thought of ‘ok, I want to focus on using this language or this framework’, but I realize this is a world of technology which changes very quickly (seriously), if I don’t update with another language/framework maybe I’ll be eroded by age.</p><p>Often I am confused about what part of the focus, whether it’s web, mobile or desktop, not infrequently the feeling of wanting to end it all just because of an error (fuck you). Starting to feel unworthy to be a programmer and always confused with the errors encountered.</p><p>Until now I still feel the same way when an error occurs, it always feels curious that the error hasn’t disappeared. Maybe someone has experienced what I experienced too.</p><p>And of course my feelings will be very happy if the error message changes even though the error is really not fixed. but at least I have been struggling to resolve the error and this is where I usually start using stackoverflow, google and the community is very helpful (most often to the <a href="https://sekolahkoding.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sekolah Koding forum</a> hahaha).</p><p>Many developers say that if we have to think of an error as a friend, when we meet him it means we will have new experiences, we will learn new things. The spirit in the face of errors that exist, all can certainly be resolved.<br>remember, it is not only you &amp; error that has been experienced by other people too (believe me).</p><p>Okay maybe that’s all this article, thank you for reading.<br><b>Happy coding!</b></p>]]></content>
